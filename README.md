**CGVQM** is a *full-reference* video quality metric that predicts perceptual differences between pairs of videos.  
Like PSNR and SSIM, it compares a **ground-truth reference** to a **distorted** version (e.g. blurry, noisy, aliased).  

What sets CGVQM apart is that it is the first metric **calibrated for distortions from advanced rendering techniques**, accounting for both **spatial** and **temporal** artifacts.

### Features

- üìä **Calibrated** on our [**CGVQD** dataset](https://github.com/IntelLabs/CGVQM), capturing complex artifacts from modern computer graphics.
- üéöÔ∏è Outputs on an **interpretable perceptual scale** (e.g. *imperceptible* ‚Üí *annoying*).
- üó∫Ô∏è Provides **error maps** to visualize *where* and *why* errors occur ‚Äî not just a single score.
- üñºÔ∏è Robust across a wide variety of content: from **stylized fantasy** to **photorealistic open worlds**, and across many rendering techniques.

CGVQM is implemented in **PyTorch**, optimized for **CUDA GPUs** (CPU also supported). See below for installation and usage instructions.

More details on the metric and dataset can be found in our paper:

If you use the metric or the dataset in your research, please cite the paper above. 

## Quickstart
1. Obtain the CGVQM codebase, by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:IntelLabs/cgvqm.git   # skip if a .zip is provided or you use Github GUI
```

2. Begin by installing the appropriate version of PyTorch (with CUDA support if available) using <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">os-specific instructions</a>. Install other requirements:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy av
```

3. After installation, run `python cgvqm.py`. This script provides a demo usage of CGVQM by comparing <i>'media/Dock_dist.mp4'</i> with <i>'media/Dock_ref.mp4'</i>. Adjust the configuration in `demo_cgvqm()` function according to your use case.

4. A sample training script is provided in `train.py` to calibrate the metric on datasets of your choice.
